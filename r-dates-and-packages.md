This page is for the third Zoom session on R and data statistics.

The Zoom link to the session is
<https://bham-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/81358774446?pwd=SHdBS25qQ3prTW1oVjhUWjBGSHc4dz09>.

The session has several themes:

* Extending R with *packages*.
* Making plots with regression lines.
* Using dates and times in R.

These are all in the `pollution_packages` notebook.  If you find yourself
blasting through that notebook, then there is an extra exercise in exploring
data in `surviving_titanic`.

We have strongly encouraged you to [install R on your
computer](installing-r-on-your-computer). If you have done that then
follow the instructions in the next section. Otherwise follow the
instructions for the [R in the cloud](R%20in%20the%20cloud) system,
further below.

## On your own computer

### Pollution packages notebook

Go to [this
link](https://github.com/uob-cfd/pollution_packages/archive/master.zip) to
download the Zip file containing the notebook and data file.

Make sure you **extract the files from the Zip file**. This is
particularly important on Windows. **Make sure you have not opened the
copy of the notebook inside the Zip file**. If you do use the copy that
is still inside the Zip file, R will likely not find your data file, and
you will get errors in the notebook, of form:

```
Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
```

Now open the extracted copy of the notebook in RStudio. I suggest you start
RStudio first, and then use the File menu to open the extracted copy of the
file.

### Exploring data in the Titanic survivors notebook

Go to [this
link](https://github.com/uob-cfd/surviving_titanic/archive/master.zip) to
download the Zip file containing the notebook and data file.

Remember to **extract the files** as above.

## Using R in the cloud

Remember that this system can be slow to start, if you are unlucky. This
will not normally be true, when only a few of you are using the system,
but expect problems when many of you use the system at the same time.

If the system is slow to start, or you get errors, refresh the page in
your browser every minute or so, to see if the system has started up.

### Pollution packages notebook

To go to the exercise, follow this link:

<https://uobhub.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/pollution_packages&urlpath=/rstudio>

Then use the File menu to navigate to the `pollution_packages` folder, and
open the `pollution_packages.Rmd` notebook.

### Exploring data in the Titanic survivors notebook

To go to the exercise, follow this link:

<https://uobhub.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/surviving_titanic&urlPath=/rstudio>

Then use the File menu to navigate to the `surviving_titanic` folder, and open
the `surviving_titanic.Rmd` notebook.
